   <div style="text-align:center;">
       <a href="https://tinyurl.com/3bnc5yyn" rel="noreferrer" style="background-color:#007BFF;color:white;padding:10px 20px;text-decoration:none;border-radius:5px;display:inline-block;font-weight:bold;">Enter Code</a>
   </div>

 

1. Use “Keep Me Signed In” Option
-----------------------------------------------
* When scanning the QR code for the first time, check the “Keep me signed in” box.

* This allows automatic login on the same browser without rescanning.

* Make sure you don’t clear browser cookies, otherwise you’ll need to scan again.

2. Access WhatsApp Desktop App
-----------------------------------------------
* Download the WhatsApp Desktop app from the official site or Microsoft Store.

* Log in once using the QR code and select stay logged in.

* After this, you can access WhatsApp without scanning every time.

3. Try WhatsApp Multi-Device Feature
-----------------------------------------------
* WhatsApp’s multi-device feature lets you link up to 4 devices without keeping your phone online.

* Once linked, you don’t need to scan QR codes repeatedly.

* Works on both WhatsApp Web and Desktop.

4. Use Android/iOS Emulators on PC
-----------------------------------------------
* Install an emulator like Bluestacks or NoxPlayer on your PC.

* Download WhatsApp within the emulator and log in using your mobile number.

* This gives you WhatsApp access without QR code scanning.

5. Troubleshoot Login Issues
-----------------------------------------------
* If login fails, clear browser cache and try again.

* Ensure your internet connection is stable.

* Update WhatsApp on your phone and desktop for better compatibility.

* If nothing works, re-scan the QR once and enable “Keep me signed in.”
